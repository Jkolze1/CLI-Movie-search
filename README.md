# Web Crawler
Basic CLI web crawler written in Node.js

# Instructions
Cd crawler (cd into the downloaded file) <br>
Then run the following, node server.js movie “movie name here” <br>
If you do not enter a movie name, it defaults to The Lion King. <br>
When you search a movie it pulls the title, year, plot and actors, from TMDB. I included some screenshots in the img folder. If you have any questions please contact me.
